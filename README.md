# TruckMe

## Description

This repository contains **Admin** and **Driver** product flavor merge into single codebase.

## Development
### Requirements & Environment setup
- [**Android Studio Artic Fox**](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive) Beta (or newer) to be able to build the app.
- JDK 1.8 or [**JDK11**](https://www.oracle.com/ph/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (working on my development setup).
- Kotlin-enabled project.

## Installation
First clone this repository (See the options on the right hand side.)

In Android Studio, use the "Open an existing Android Studio project", find the downloaded project folder and select the (`truck-me-android`).

Alternatively use the `./gradlew build` command to build the project directly.

1. [Get an API Key](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials?project=truckme-debug-326812).
2. Open the `local.properties` file in root project (you must switch project structure from `Android` to `Project` in the top-left corner).
3. Add a single line to `local.properties` that looks like `MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`, where `YOUR_API_KEY` is the API key you obtained in the first step.
4. For `Places` and `Directions` API Key. Just copy your `MAPS API KEY` and add a single line to `gradle.properties` `MAPS_API_KEY="PLACE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`, where `PLACE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` is the same as your API key in the `local.properties`. see pull request [#23](https://github.com/forceporquillo/truck-me-android/pull/23)
5. Build and run.

## Switching between Admin and Driver build variant
Navigate to ```Build Variants```. (Can be found on the bottom left side of project panel)

Note: use only the <b>adminDebug</b> and <b>driverDebug</b> type for testing.

Clean and run the project. Alternatively use the `./gradlew build` command to build the project directly.

## Modules

Modules are collection of source files and build settings that allow you to divide a project into discrete units of functionality. In this case apart from dividing by functionality/responsibility, existing the following dependence between them:

The above graph shows the app modularization:
-    `:app` module depends on `:core` and `:lib`.
-    `:core` and `:lib` doesnâ€™t have any dependency.

#### App module

The `:app` module is an [com.android.application](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/), which is needed to create the app bundle.  It is also responsible for initiating the [dependency graph](https://github.com/google/dagger), [play core](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/play/core/release-notes) and another project global libraries, differentiating especially between different app environments.

#### Core module

The `:core` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) for serving network requests, accessing to the database and shared preferences. Providing the data source for the many features that require it.

#### Libs module

The `:libs` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/dynamic-delivery) only contains inset animations, drag and UI layout manipulation.
